# Youtube-Clone
My first HTML and CSS project



Created a YouTube clone using HTML and CSS, applying foundational web development skills. Learned essential concepts like HTML structure, CSS basics, and advanced layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid. Implemented hovers, transitions, and shadows to enhance user interaction. This project helped me understand web design and build a visually appealing, functional replica of YouTube's interface.
